# MESSs
MESSs is an acronym standing for Make Easy Sophisicated Songs simple
Hi! My name is Charles Griffin and I'm the owner of the MESSs project. Although I anticipate other contributors to join at later times, I built the project from idea to implentation. I'm expert in Systems Design and programming, with 35+ years of software development.
MESSs makes the development of sophisticated and simple songs easy. Designed and coded with accessibility in mind, MESSs is easy to use for everyone, including people with limited mobility.
